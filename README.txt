## geo1001_hw01.py is python code for assignment 01 Lecture GEO1001

### STEP IN THIS CODE

### IMPORT MODULE
Import every important module to run the scripts. 

### IMPORT DATA
Data used in this assignment is collected from 5 heat sensor. We have to pay attention regarding the path location of the data

### TASK01
# Compute mean statistics (mean, variance and standard deviation for each of the sensors variables)
# Create 1 plot that contains histograms for the 5 sensors Temperature values
# Create 1 plot where frequency poligons for the 5 sensors Temperature values overlap in different colors with a legend.
# Generate 3 plots that include the 5 sensors boxplot for: Wind Speed, Wind Direction and Temperature.

### TASK02
# Plot PMF, PDF and CDF for the 5 sensors Temperature values in independent plots (or subplots)
# For the Wind Speed values, plot the pdf and the kernel density estimation

### TASK03
# Compute the correlations between all the sensors for the variables: Temperature, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), Crosswind Speed. Perform correlation between sensors with the same variable, not between two different variables; for example, correlate Temperature time series between sensor A and B

### TASK04
# Plot the CDF for all the sensors and for variables Temperature and Wind Speed, then compute the 95% confidence intervals for variables Temperature and Wind Speed for all the sensors and save them in a table (txt or csv form)
# Compute different mean from some combining sensor
# Compute p-value from some combining sensor
